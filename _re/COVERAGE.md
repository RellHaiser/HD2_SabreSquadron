# Client coverage: baseline tools

Work toward the client coverage plan (readher's `CLIENT_COVERAGE_PLAN.md`, 2026-11-10). It tracks
three measures separately: original-function accounting, port function execution, and port line and
branch execution. This file covers step 1 (a reproducible baseline) and the start of step 2 (the
address ledger). Nothing here measures execution yet; that is step 3.

## Harness suites: `_re/harness/run_suites.py`

One runner and manifest for every harness build script under `_re/harness` (37 suites).

    python _re/harness/run_suites.py                 all suites (about 25 minutes)
    python _re/harness/run_suites.py "net.*" crowd   by name or pattern
    python _re/harness/run_suites.py --list          the manifest

- It writes `report.md` and `report.json` to `%TEMP%\hd2_suites` (`--work`). The report records the
  revision, uncommitted changes, MinGW and MSVC, the data folder, and per suite the status, the
  parsed counts, the time, the executable's hash and the log.
- Each suite's executable is deleted before its build, so a failed compile is reported as
  `build-failed` and never runs a stale binary. Many build scripts carry on to copy and run after
  a failed g++.
- Output is bounded (the last 256 KB per run) and runs are killed at their time limit.
- The vehicle builds run their inputs in 12 parallel chunks, each in its own working folder,
  because tests write scratch files to the current folder.
- Inputs are made from the game data (`--data`, default `H:\HD2_Unpacked`):
  - the 37 car models and 176 damage models (`export_cars.py`);
  - the 22 missions (each one with a `Vertanim.bin`, plus AFRICA2);
  - the cars' property blobs (`carparams.py`).
- Prerequisites: MinGW at `C:\nim-2.2.6\dist\mingw32`, MSVC `vcvars32.bat` (crash.msvc), and the
  game data. `checkpoints` and `profile` have `H:\HD2_Unpacked` hard-coded in their build scripts.
  `mp_setup` needs its map lists and profiles (`--mp-data`), which aren't on this machine.
- Not run: vehicle_params' original-reader comparison (ORIG_DIR), and its `apply.exe` (built only).
  The mutation lists are not part of the baseline run.

### Baseline, 2026-11-10 (revision 59f8b0b0)

The first run gave 33 pass, 1 fail, 2 crashed, 1 missing prerequisite. All three failures were out
of date tests, not port bugs:

- **vehicle.text and vehicle.factory crashed.** The bar test passed the pool list a raw buffer with
  a map name at +1. Commit f807aab5 makes the pool list read a real `C_MpMap` (its name is at +4 in
  the port), so the raw buffer crashed it. The test now passes a `C_MpMap`.
- **vehicle.text, hotkey.hkParts.** Commit 76b55336 posts `MENU_MSG_KEYBOARD_OFF` with value 1, as
  the original does (0x0064eec0), and OnKeyClick forwards to OnClick; the test's two checks still
  expected 0.
- **net.session.** Commit 38a422a7 hosts with `DPNSESSION_NODPNSVR` as well (flags 0x41); the test
  still expected 1.
- **vehicle.factory, description.dsWrite.** This was the runner's fault: parallel chunks in one
  folder shared the test's `mpdesc_test.txt`.

So the runner catches failing checks, crashes and broken inputs. The latest result is in the report.

## Address ledger: `tools/address_ledger.py`

    python tools/address_ledger.py                   writes _re/coverage/ledger.csv, prints a summary
    python tools/address_ledger.py --list open:live  the rows of one disposition

One row per original function in the game range: 12,306 functions and 3,861,288 bytes, with unwind
and catch funclets left out as `port_stats.py` does.

- **Disposition:**
  - `hand`, `absorbed`, `idiom` or `empty`;
  - otherwise `open:<triage bucket>` (live, tiny, static, dead, dead-eh?).
- **`src`:** the exact source lines naming the address. There is no nearest-address credit.
- **`section`:** the `ported.txt` section the address is listed under.
- **`review`:** taken from `_re/ledger_review.txt` (`ADDRESS DISPOSITION text`). A review never
  changes the measured disposition; the summary counts reviewed rows separately.

| Disposition | Functions | Original bytes |
|---|---:|---:|
| hand | 9,609 | 3,425,433 |
| absorbed | 1,168 | 183,578 |
| idiom | 287 | 6,103 |
| empty | 8 | 40 |
| open:live | 534 | 60,203 |
| open:tiny | 304 | 2,946 |
| open:static | 6 | 163 |
| open:dead | 278 | 175,650 |
| open:dead-eh? | 112 | 7,172 |

Findings for step 2:

- 1,680 `hand` rows (169,604 bytes) and 1,048 `absorbed` rows (80,097 bytes) have no exact address
  in the sources.
- `ported.txt` doesn't only list ported code. Some of its non-absorbed sections list code marked
  done so that tier 1 stops generating it, and their headers say so: "unreferenced in this exe ...
  not ported", "code without callers (not ported)", static-guard thunks, STL shapes. The largest
  such group is 641 rows under "versions" (64 KB), which needs a look.
  - A rough match on such headers covers 1,057 `hand` rows (441 KB). That is an upper bound to
    review, not a count of unported code.
  - Either way, `hand` overstates "ported by hand". Reviewed rows should get their own disposition
    (unreachable, std replacement, absorbed by a named function).

## Stats tools

`tools/port_stats.py` and `tools/coverage_map.py` read this repository's own `_re` and `src`.
`coverage_map.py --exe-only` needs no DLL index. The LS3DF index isn't in the repository: pass
`--ls3df-re` or set the env `LS3DF_RE`. Without it, the LS3DF rows are left out with a note.
`coverage_map.py`'s "verified" state is still based on source-name regexes. The plan replaces it
with the ledger plus measured results (step 6).
